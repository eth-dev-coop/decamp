### Open Source Common Good Liqudity Pools for People

Our mission is to create a place where creators are fairly awarded for the things they build. We will do this by providing a place for individuals to distinguish themselves by the trade they practice. Community leaders will create the high level member pools via an easy to use interface and connected wallet. These pools can be created by anyone, although pools that distinguish themselves and gain reputations will most likely be awarded the most work prospects.

Once members are admitted to the pool of their choice they may potentially end up working with members of other pools since most projects will require more than one tradecraft. 

Users and managers can send project proposals into the system. The projects will allow teams to submit proposals on how a project could be potentially managed. These proposals will have estimated costs that stakeholders will have to crowdsource funds or supply themselves which will be locked into the contract. These funds will be distributed in one of two ways, a lump sum at time of completion or series of installments.

We will design an easy to use api for other blockchain developers to call into our contracts to accomplish a service that members in one of our pools may provide.

There will be a federalized treasury contract where member, stakeholder and pool creator fees will be submitted. These funds can only be distributred by governance proposals. The fee amounts are subject to governance proposals. 

The collective will have federalized leadship structures that will employ developers and administrators to foster growth and maintain order in the collective. All leaders will be subjected to governance maybe even impeachment. 

We will consider the idea of an insurance contract all users will pay fees into. This insurance contract will be managed by a federalized member pool of paid underwriters and adjusters who will determine the value of a proposal. If the submitter chooses to insure the proposal they can potentially be awarded damages from our claims member pool. 

Member pools can create store fronts where they can show case their members capabilities and when non-members come to the application they can submit proposals via the store front or submit a generic proposal to one or many member pools of their choosing.
